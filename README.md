# FakeDrake's Dot Emacs #

This is just my dot emacs. You are free to use it. It is based on el-get. I know I am not really using the package initializations correctly but we will get there. The nice thing about el-get is that it collects the packages I need from the internet so i dont have to fill this repo with submodules and emacswiki files that I do not maintain. Note that this (in particular the theme) will only work with emacs >= 24
